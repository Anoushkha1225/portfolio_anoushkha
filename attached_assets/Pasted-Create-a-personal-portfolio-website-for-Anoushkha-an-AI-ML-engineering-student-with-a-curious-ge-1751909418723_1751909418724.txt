Create a personal portfolio website for Anoushkha, an AI & ML engineering student with a curious, geeky, and slightly quirky vibe. She’s just starting out professionally, so the focus should be on her academic + GitHub projects, passion for AI, and energetic personality.

💫 Design Theme:
Minimal but dynamic.

Soft pastel color palette (lavender, mint, baby blue, light peach) on a dark background (#121212 or #0d0d0d).

Use subtle animated cursor effects (e.g., trailing glow, dot ripple, color shift on hover).

Smooth transitions and microinteractions throughout.

✍️ Font Pairing:
Space Grotesk (headers – modern, techy but friendly)

Inter (body – clean and readable)

📌 Sections to Include:
🏠 Home / About Me
Fun line like:
“Hey, I’m Anoushkha 👋 I explore AI, build cool things, and ask ‘what if?’ a lot.”

Short bullet list of identity points:

🧠 AI & ML Engineering Student

🧪 LSTM + Transformers Learner

🧵 Curious Human | Notebook Hoarder

🎮 Gamer with a thing for tech quirks

Add a “View Projects” button and “Download Resume” button.

💼 Projects
Display in animated cards with hover effects. Each card includes a:

Title (from GitHub)

Short description

Tags if possible (e.g., #ML, #Python, #AI)

Link to GitHub repo

✅ Pull projects dynamically from GitHub profile: https://github.com/Anoushkha1225
✅ Also manually feature this project (not in GitHub yet):
Deepfake Detection using LSTM – Built a deep learning model to detect face-swapped videos.

📓 Blog / Notes
Optional. A section for future thoughts or notes on AI, product ideas, or experiments.
Use placeholders or “Coming Soon” if needed.

💡 Product Beliefs
Clean grid layout of short beliefs like:

✅ AI should enhance, not replace.

✅ Curiosity > Expertise.

✅ Simplicity is powerful.

✅ Discovery is nonlinear.

🧩 Fun Facts / Personality
A playful section with pastel icons or illustrations:

🎮 Currently Playing: Add any games (e.g., Genshin, Stardew Valley?)

📚 Currently Reading: Any book title you like

🧠 Into: Retro tech, pixel art, notebooks

🐾 Include an easter egg — like a glowing cheese animation or pixel corgi on hover
